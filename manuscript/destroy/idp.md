# API (CRDs) & State Management (Controllers) Destruction

```bash
source .env
```

> Watch [Nix for Everyone: Unleash Devbox for Simplified Development](https://youtu.be/WiFLtcBvGMU) if you are not familiar with Devbox. Alternatively, you can skip Devbox and install all the tools listed in `devbox.json` yourself.

> Skip executing `devbox shell` if you are already inside the Shell from one of the previous episodes.

```bash
devbox shell
```

> Watch [The Future of Shells with Nushell! Shell + Data + Programming Language](https://youtu.be/zoX_S6d-XU4) if you are not familiar with Nushell. Alternatively, you can inspect the `dot.nu` script and transform the instructions in it to Bash or ZShell if you prefer not to use that Nushell script.

```sh
source .env

./dot.nu destroy idp
```
