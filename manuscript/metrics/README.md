# Metrics

Hero is relieved that they donâ€™t have to choose between Prometheus and OpenTelemetry for standardization, whew. OpenTelemetry understands Prometheus metrics and Prometheus can use the OpenTelemetry SDKs to correlate Prometheus metrics with other system data. 

But when it comes to metrics, is it enough to have just Prometheus? Or should Hero choose a tool like Thanos or Cortex that builds on Prometheus and adds features like high availability, horizontal scaling, and long-term storage? What differentiates Thanos and Cortex from one another?
