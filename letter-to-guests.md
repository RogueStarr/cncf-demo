Thank you for being a guest on You Choose! This will be so much fun.  

## Need-to-knows:

**Please join the stream by clicking the streamyard link in your calendar invite at the scheduled time.** If you haven't received an invite yet, please contact Whitney or Viktor. Your invite may not have a link yet - that link will show up a few days before your scheduled show. The calendar invite start includes extra time for introductions and tech check before we go live.

**Please definitely use headphones (or earbuds), and a microphone is nice too if you have one.** We fancy like that.  

**You're responsible for a 5-minute (or less) presentation about the technology that you're representing.** You are welcome to screen share and use slides and/or show a demo. But to keep things fair we will be strict about the 5-minute limit! Consider yourself warned!

We also recommend that you start with a simple, one-sentence description of your tool to set the scene for your presentation. Some viewers may have never heard of your technology.  

**You'll be available for questions about your technology during the Q&A section of the show.**

**You'll give a closing statement at the end of the show.** Seriously just one or two sentences.  

## Nice-to-knows:

**Your normal virtual background won't be available in the streamyard interface.** Please come ready to share the room that you are in, or prepared to upload a virtual background.  

**This is not a competition.** Sure, one technology will get chosen, but that may simply mean that there is more interest in that technology, or that it better suits our use case. It doesn't mean that technology is objectively superior. Let's keep the vibes friendly and fun.

**The You Choose format goes like this:**
* Recap the decisions made in the app's journey so far (<=5 min.)
* Recap of the technology that was chosen from last week's episode (<=5 min.)
* Implement said technology (<=5 min.)
* Intro current episode: why is this step necessary? (<=5 min.)
* Introduce guests
* Each case presented in <= 5 min.
* Audience questions
* Call for voting
* Closing case presentations (20 sec.)
